# RTE-project
Build a full data pipeline from data ingestion to visualization using the RTE API for French electricity data.

# 1. Project Scope and Objectives
Goal: Build a full data pipeline from data ingestion to visualization using the RTE API for French electricity data.
Timeframe: 1 month
Key Skills to Showcase:
API Data Ingestion
Data Storage (using Snowflake)
Data Transformation and Enrichment (using DBT)
Orchestration (using Airflow or Prefect)
Visualization (using Python or Tableau)
CI/CD for Automation and Deployment
Cloud Storage Management
Security (API Key Management)
Documentation and Presentation

# 2. Data Ingestion
API Integration:
Use the RTE API to pull live French electricity data. Since the data updates often, decide on a frequency (e.g., every hour) for pulling new data.
Tools: Python for API requests.
API Security: Use environment variables or a secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager or .env files) to securely store your API key and secret code.
Batch vs. Stream Processing:
Batch Processing: Ingest data at fixed intervals (e.g., every hour). Suitable if you’re not dealing with real-time updates.
Stream Processing: Process data in real-time as it arrives. More complex, but useful if you want immediate updates.

# 3. Data Storage
Snowflake:
Store raw and processed data in Snowflake. This will involve setting up a Snowflake account and creating necessary tables for storing the ingested data.
Cost Management: Snowflake offers a free tier with limited usage, which should suffice for a small project.

# 4. Data Transformation and Enrichment
DBT (Data Build Tool):
Set up DBT for transforming raw data into a clean, structured format within Snowflake.
Implement data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, correcting data types) and enrichment processes.
Enrichment Example: Add external data, like weather data, to see how it correlates with electricity usage.

# 5. Data Orchestration
Airflow/Prefect:
Use Apache Airflow or Prefect to orchestrate your data pipeline. This will allow you to schedule the data ingestion, transformation, and visualization tasks.
Example Workflow:
Ingest data from the RTE API.
Load raw data into Snowflake.
Run DBT transformations.
Update the visualization.

# 6. Visualization
Python (Plotly/Dash) or Tableau:
If building a dashboard, use Python’s Plotly/Dash to create interactive visualizations hosted on a web server.
If creating a workbook, use Tableau to design the visualizations, pulling the data directly from Snowflake.
Recommendation: Dash offers more control and is a great way to showcase programming skills, while Tableau is excellent for data storytelling and is widely recognized.

# 7. Cloud Storage and Hosting
Data Storage: Snowflake for data storage.
Hosting: If using Dash, consider deploying the dashboard on a free Heroku tier or an AWS EC2 instance with careful monitoring to avoid costs.
CI/CD:
Use GitHub Actions for automating tests, deployments, and updates. This will demonstrate your ability to maintain and deploy your pipeline consistently.

# 8. Security
API Key Management:
Store API keys securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.
Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in your codebase or GitHub repository.

# 9. Documentation
README: Create a comprehensive README file in your GitHub repository explaining the project, its objectives, and how to set it up.
Technical Documentation: Document the pipeline, including the architecture, tools used, and how each component interacts.
Presentation: Consider writing a blog post or recording a video walkthrough of your project to explain your work and showcase your skills.

# 10. Project Timeline
Week 1: Set up data ingestion (API integration and Snowflake).
Week 2: Implement data transformation (DBT) and begin orchestration setup.
Week 3: Finalize orchestration, build visualization, and set up CI/CD.
Week 4: Final testing, security checks, documentation, and project deployment.
